= Execution Comparison Analysis =

The Execution Comparison is an analysis tool that compares the execution time between two groups of traces. This feature is particularly useful when analyzing two runs of a trace â€” one that performs well and another that doesn't.

== Structure of the Execution Comparison ==
The Execution Comparison is made up of 3 distinct sections:
# Data Selection (Top)
# Filtering Query (Middle)
# Differential Flame Graph (Bottom)

== Setting Up the Comparison ==

To begin using the Execution Comparison:

# Create an experiment in Trace Compass.
# In the Data Selection Section, select the traces you want to compare by toggling them.
#* By default, this compares the traces over their entire time interval.

== Specifying a Time Interval ==

To compare traces within a specific time range, use one of these methods:

# '''Using The Event Density Graphs:''' Select the region you want to compare in the Event Density Graphs using your mouse's left button.
# '''Manual time interval setting:''' Modify the time range panels (From and To panels) under the Event Density Graphs.

== Understanding the Differential Flame Graph ==

Once you've selected your traces and time interval, a differential flame graph will appear at the bottom of the screen. 
This graph visualizes the difference in execution time between the selected traces.

=== Color Coding ===

The colors in the differential flame graph represent the difference between the traces selected in Group B and those in Group A:

* '''Red:''' Functions take longer to execute in Group B compared to Group A
* '''Blue:''' Functions are faster in Group B than in Group A
* '''White:''' Little difference in execution time (< 10%)
* '''More contrasting colors:''' Bigger difference in execution time (> 50%)

=== Percentages ===

The percentages shown on the differential flame graph indicate the magnitude of the difference in execution time between Group B and Group A for each function.

== Additional Features ==

=== Reset Time Interval ===

At any point, you can press the Reset Time Interval buttons to set the selected traces and time intervals to the initial state for Group A and Group B respectively.

=== Filtering Query Section ===

Located between the Data Selection Section and the Differential Flame Graph, the Filtering Query Section allows for easy reproduction and sharing of experiments.

To use this feature:
# Press the "Get filtering query" button.
# A textual prompt will be generated.
# This prompt can be shared to reproduce the exact same conditions used for the Execution Comparison.

== Best Practices ==

* Start by comparing a well-performing trace with a poorly performing one to quickly identify areas of significant difference.
* Use the time interval selection to focus on specific periods of interest, such as when performance issues are known to occur.
* Share the filtering query with team members to ensure everyone is analyzing the same data in the same way.

== Troubleshooting ==

If you encounter issues or unexpected results:
* Ensure that the traces in Group A and Group B are comparable (e.g., from the same system or application).
* Check that the selected time intervals for both groups cover the same period of interest.
* If the differential flame graph appears blank, try adjusting the time interval or selecting different traces.
