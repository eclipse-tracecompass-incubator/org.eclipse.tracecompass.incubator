== Generating a trace ==
There are two ways to generate a trace either using Systrace.py or atrace directly

===Systrace.py===
Follow procedures found here: https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/systrace.html  and then import resulting HTML file in Trace Compass

===atrace===
Open shell on phone using adb. When running an atrace tracing make sure to use option -o in order to write the output to a file. Once tracing is done just import the output file in Trace Compass.
ex:
# adb shell atrace -o gfx
